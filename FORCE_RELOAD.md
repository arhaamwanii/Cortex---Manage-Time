# ğŸ”„ FORCE RELOAD CHROME EXTENSION

## Problem
Chrome caches popup.js files even when you click "reload" on the extensions page. Changes don't apply until you force a complete reload.

## Solution: Complete Reload Steps

### Method 1: Disable & Re-enable (RECOMMENDED)
1. Open Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions/`
2. Find your "Elevate" extension
3. **Turn OFF** the toggle switch (disable completely)
4. Wait 2 seconds
5. **Turn ON** the toggle switch (re-enable)
6. Test the popup - you should now see "v2.1 - Cache Busted!" in console

### Method 2: Remove & Re-add
1. Go to `chrome://extensions/`
2. Click **"Remove"** button on Elevate extension
3. Click **"Load unpacked"**
4. Select your extension folder again
5. Test the popup

### Method 3: Developer Reload
1. Go to `chrome://extensions/`
2. Enable "Developer mode" (top right)
3. Click **"Reload"** on your extension
4. If that doesn't work, try Method 1

## âœ… How to Verify Changes Applied

Open the extension popup and check the console (F12). You should see:
```
POPUP.JS: Script loaded and executing v2.1 - Cache Busted!
POPUP.JS: Initializing popup with DOM fully ready v2.1...
```

If you still see the old logs without "v2.1", the cache didn't clear - try Method 1.

## ğŸ§ª Test the Fixes

1. **Test Element Detection:** Look for "All critical elements found" in console
2. **Test Instant UI:** Toggle website blocker - should update immediately
3. **Test Debugging:** Should see detailed element information in console
4. **Test Retry Logic:** Should say "5 retries" instead of "3 retries"

## ğŸ”§ Still Not Working?

If you're still seeing issues:
1. Close ALL Chrome windows
2. Restart Chrome completely
3. Reload extension using Method 1
4. Clear browser cache: Chrome Settings > Privacy > Clear browsing data > Cached images and files

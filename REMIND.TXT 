some of this functionlatiy should already be there, at least the basis for it. take a look into the code base and see will that work and what changes you would need to make to it work 

analyze what i said and above take a deep look into the code base then go and make changes - make sure it workd , make sure it matchs app theme 

DON'T BREAK ANYTHIGN 

-------------------------------------------


- CHANGE TEH TEXT COLOUR OF THE REMINDER AND OTHR HEADERS ALL HEADERS LIKE THESE TO WHITE 
- CHNAGE SCROLL BAR  TO BLACK COLOUT AND MAKE IT VERY VERY SMALL ALMOST INVISIBEL

DON'T BREAK ANYTHIGN , MAKE SURE EVERTHING WORKS 


--------------------------------------------

- THE TIMER CURRENTLY FIRES AT AN ONE MINUTE INTREVAL IRRRESPETIVE OF WHAT FREQUENY IS SET IN THE REMINDER CONROLLER ON THE POPUP : MAKE SURE MATCHS THE POPUP FREEQYECY 
- SOME TIMES IT DOES NOT PLAY AT ALL : DEATICH IT FROM MOST OF THE FUCNTIONALITY MAKE IT SOME WHAT STAND ALONE 
- CURRENLY IT PLAYS MULTIPLE TYPES OF BEEPS MAKE SURE IT PLAYS A SINGLE TYPE OF BEEP BY DEFAUL (UNLESS WHATEVER THE USER HAS SET) - WHICH IS LIKE THAT ONE SOUND BEEP NOT THAT TWO SOUND BEEP 

- PLAYS WIHOUT A SET TASK AS WELL, BEEP PLAYING SHOULD ONLY DEPEND ON IS IT ENABLED OR NOT NOT ON ANYTHING ELSE NOT EVEN ON WHETHER THE TIMER IS ONGOING OR NOT 
_________

when ideling i.e no task in ongoing 
: start a task should be shown on the new tab instead of the timer or above it

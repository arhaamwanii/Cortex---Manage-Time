## What Makes This Special

### üåê **Truly Universal**
Unlike other timer extensions that only work on specific pages, this timer appears on **every website** you visit. Whether you're reading articles, working on docs, or scrolling social media, your timer is always there to keep you focused.

### üéØ **Smart Position Memory**
The timer remembers exactly where you placed it on each website. Move it to the top-right on GitHub? It'll be there next time. Bottom-left on YouTube? Same spot. Each domain gets its own saved position, so your timer feels like it belongs on every page.

### üñ±Ô∏è **Drag & Drop Anywhere**
Click and drag the timer to any corner, edge, or position on the page. It's not stuck in a fixed location - you control where it lives on each website.

### ‚ö° **Seamless Synchronization**
Start the timer on one tab, switch to another - it keeps running. Pause it on YouTube, resume it on Stack Overflow. The timer state is synchronized across your entire browser, so you never lose track of your focus sessions.

### üé® **Minimal & Beautiful**
Clean, modern design that doesn't clutter your browsing experience. The timer only shows controls when you hover over it, keeping your workspace distraction-free.

## How It Works

### The New Tab Experience
Open a new tab and you'll see your timer perfectly centered on a pitch-black background. It's like having a dedicated focus space that's just one click away.

### On Every Website
The timer appears as a floating element that you can:
- **Hover** to reveal controls (Start/Pause, Reset, Set Time)
- **Drag** to reposition anywhere on the page
- **Click** to interact with buttons

### Smart Features
- **Auto-save positions** per website
- **Cross-tab synchronization** 
- **Desktop notifications** when timer completes
- **Customizable duration** (default: 25 minutes)
- **Responsive design** that works on any screen size
